# Automated-Dataset-Generation-with-Grounding-DINO-Segment-Anything-Model-SAM-

This repository will automatically annotate your images using two groundbreaking models - Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model (SAM). You can then use this dataset to train a real-time object detection or instance segmentation model. Annotation of images using polygons in the traditional way is extremely time-consuming and expensive. With Grounding DINO and SAM, initial annotation takes only a few minutes and your work is reduced to manual verification of obtained labels.
